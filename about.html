                        <h3>The Spider Bite</h3>
                        <p>Peter Parker was an ordinary high school student living with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in Queens, New York. During a science exhibition, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider that had been exposed to radiation. This bite would change his life forever.</p>
                        <p>Initially unaware of the changes happening to his body, Peter soon discovered he had gained incredible powers: superhuman strength, agility, the ability to cling to walls, and an amazing "spider-sense" that warned him of danger.</p>

                        <p>At first, Peter used his powers for personal gain, appearing on television and in wrestling matches. However, his selfishness would lead to tragedy when he failed to stop a burglar who later killed his beloved Uncle Ben.</p>
                        <p>This devastating loss taught Peter the most important lesson of his life: "With great power comes great responsibility." From that moment forward, Peter dedicated his life to protecting others as the amazing Spider-Man.</p>

                        <p>Despite the challenges of balancing his personal life with his superhero duties, Peter continues to protect the innocent and uphold the values his Uncle Ben taught him.</p>
